	There is also a lot of polution. We can help by driving hybrid cars or all electric. Teslas are all electric and can go up to 200 miles on one charge! Elon Musk is the founder of Teslaand Tesla is a custom made car shipped to you. THere is the base model and you can get sadd ons to your Tesla. YOu pick the color and wether you want a Model S or a Model X. You can actaully pre-prder the Model 3 now. The Model 3 hasn't come out yet, but it's around 35,000 dollars. The intrior isn't as nice, but it still has all of the Tesla full on electric experience. 
	Toyota, Nissan, and some other car companies have hybrid cars along with gas cars. Some car companies have electric cars too. Tesla is one of the few all electric car companies, and it has an awesome amount of miles per charge too! A Tesla could get you from Phoenix to Flagstaff without any problem at all. To inprove the success of electric car companies, we need to build ore quick charging stations.
	Lucid is another all electric car company. They do not have any cars out yet, but they do have a design. The Air is a very expensive, nice, all electric viacle that will be realesed in 2018 by Lucid Motors.
