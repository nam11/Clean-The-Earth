  Elon Musk is an amazing man! He created Tesla, Space X, and so much more. Some companies he created he got over thrown and they changed their name. He is fascanating, creative, and very inpowering.
  Tesla comes in two different cars. The Model S and the Model X. The Model X has doors that open upward rather than outward. Tesla is also going to have a Model 3. Pre orders have already been taken. The Model 3 is in the 35,000 price range. It is so much cheaper because it is very base oin the inside but you still get the all electric Tesla experience while driving it. You order you Tesla on;ine. You pick what Model you want, choose your color and then you can add on whatever other features you want. 
  Space X is trying to make space travel cheaper. Elon Musk had an idea to fly a plant to Mars and let it grow, but as he saw how expensive people were selling thigs for, he changed his mind. He wanted to do space travel right. He got a group of people together. They built a rocket and keep changing things to make it possible to luanch into space. Because Elon was able to really get in to price research, he was able to get the price of building it down to about 6 million dollars! Cheaper than space travel has ever been.
  Tesla is going to try to start getting prices down lower so electric cars can be in a reasonable price range for a wider audiance so more people who don't have as much money can afford a Tesla. The farther Tesla prices lower while keeping the Tesla experience, the more successful Tesla will be.
  Space X has low prices covered. Space X needs to make those tweeks to the rocket so they can have a successful launch. Elon's motive for Space X was to show the public that space travel can be so much cheaper than what people are making it. To convey that message the best, they need to have a rocket get from Earth to space.
